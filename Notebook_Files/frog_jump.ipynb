    "### Frog Jump Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Frog Jumps algorithm is part of the greedy algorithms.  The frog begins at position 0 in the river.  Its goal is to get to position n.  There are lilypads at various positions.  There is always a lilypad at position 0 and position n.  The frog can jump at most r units at a time.  The goal for this algorithm is to find the path the frog should take to minimize jumps, assuming a soultion exits.\n",
